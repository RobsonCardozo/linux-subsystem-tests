Day 1: Github works - Ok for now. (But you have to create another SSH key)
       VSCode cause permission's bug (cause you are using 2 users at same time, which causes a conflict).

Day 2: Github still works fine.
       User permission's problem solved by activating VsCode by subsystem terminal. After that, nothing goes wrong.
       Now I have the better of both worlds. :D
